  topic: Course Overview, Making Decisions Under Uncertainty
  description: In this lecture we provide an overview of data science and where it might head in the future.
    We discuss the importance of decision making rather than simple inference. As a first step in this direction we
    cover the different angles through which a simple hypothesis test can be viewed.

  topic: Review of Frequentist and Bayesian Decision-Making
  description: In this lecture we continue investigating the intricacies that arise when running a simple hypothesis test.
    We look at the difference between the frequentist and the Bayesian view of hypothesis testing. We further develop these ideas by
    introducing a decision-theoretic framework. Using this framework we can mathematically define both Bayesian and frequentist decision rules.

  topic: False Discovery Rate Control
  description: In this lecture we continue developing our decision-theoretic framework. In particular we consider properties of the risk of
    various loss functions. The main portion of the lecture is dedicated to false discovery rate control. We look at two ideas that go beyond
    basic hypothesis testing. We consider the Bonferroni test which is a naive way of controlling the family-wise error rate. We then look into
    Benjamini-Hochberg which is a more elaborate method that controls the false discovery rate.

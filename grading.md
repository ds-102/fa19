There will be 1 challenging project and 8 homework assignments. Assignments must be completed individually and will mix programming and short answer questions. Lab assignments will be graded on completion and correctness, but all test cases will be public. Your two lowest labs will be dropped.

- 30% homeworks and labs (20% homework, 10% labs)
- 15% Project
- 5% Attendance (or 0% if opting out)
- 20% Midterm
- 30% Final (or 35% if opting out of attendance)

(The midterm will tentatively be in class on October 16th. The final exam will be December 13th 11:30am - 2:30pm)

### Slip Days
- 5 days of slip time you can use on homeworks or projects.
- One minute late = one slip day.
- After you use slip days, 20% off per day.
- Intended to cover unforeseen circumstances.


### On Time Policy (try not to be late)

Each student gets an extension budget of 5 slip days. You can use the extension
on homework and project assignments during the semester. Do not plan to use
your slip-time; it is there for unforeseen circumstances! These are rounded up, so if you are
1 minute late then 1 slip day will be used.

After you have used up your slip-time budget, any assignment handed in late
will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer number
of days. No assignment will be accepted more than 5 days late.

### Collaboration Policy (don't cheat)

Data science is a collaborative activity.
While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually.
If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook.
Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final.
We will be following the [EECS
departmental policy on Academic
Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-dishonesty), so
be sure you are familiar with it.

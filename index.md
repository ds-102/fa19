<!-- # DS102: Data, Inference, and Decisions -->

This course develops the probabilistic foundations of inference in data science, and builds a comprehensive view of the modeling and decision-making life cycle in data science including its human, social, and ethical implications. Topics include: frequentist and Bayesian decision-making, permutation testing, false discovery rate, probabilistic interpretations of models, Bayesian hierarchical models, basics of experimental design, confidence intervals, causal inference, Thompson sampling, optimal control, Q-learning, differential privacy, clustering algorithms, recommendation systems and an introduction to machine learning tools including decision trees, neural networks and ensemble methods.

This class is listed as [STAT 102](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2019-fall-stat-102-001-lec-001).

## Prerequisites

While we are working to make this class widely accessible we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites :

1. **Principles and Techniques of Data Science:** [**DS100**](http://ds100.org) covers important computational and statistical skills that will be necessary for DS102.


1. **Probability:** *Probability and Random Processes* [**EECS126**](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee126), or *Concepts of Probability* [**STAT134**](http://www.stat134.org/), or *Probability for Data Science* [**STAT140**](http://prob140.org/about/), or *Probability and Risk Analysis for Engineers* [**IEOR172**](https://tbp.berkeley.edu/syllabi/484/download/). EECS126 and STAT140 are prefered. These courses cover the probabilistic tools that will form the underpinning for the concepts covered in DS102.

1. **Math:** *Linear Algebra & Differential Equations* [**Math54**](https://math.berkeley.edu/~nikhil/courses/54.f18/), or *Linear Algebra* [**MATH110**](https://math.berkeley.edu/~mcivor/math110su13/), or both *Designing Information Devices and Systems I* [**EE16A**](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/sp19/) and *Designing Information Devices and Systems II* [**EE16B**](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/), or *Linear Algebra for Data Science* [**Stat89a**](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/s18-lads/), or *Introduction to Mathematical Physics* [**PHYSICS89**](https://imgur.com/a/TKzcK1Z). We will need some basic concepts like linear operators, eigenvectors, derivatives, and integrals to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms.

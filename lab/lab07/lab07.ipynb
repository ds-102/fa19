    "Suppose that we measure a set of features $\\{X^*,X\\}$, which affect an observed target outcome $Y$, for multiple different units. We are interested in finding the average causal effect of $X^*$ on $Y$. The effect we are interested in is **causal** because we want to know how $Y$ changes if all randomness other than $X^*$ remains fixed, and only $X^*$ changes. We will refer to $X^*$ as the \"treatment.\" In general, $X$ might be multi-dimensional, however for the purpose of this exercise we take $X^*, X\\in\\mathbb{R}$."

    "One way to get around this issue is by using instrumental variables (IVs). A valid instrument $Z$ is a variable which is independent of $\\xi_Y$, and affects $Y$ only through $X^*$. Then, one way to estimate $\\alpha$ is to first \"guess\" $X^*$ from $\\{Z,X\\}$ (denoted $\\hat X^*$), and then regress $Y$ onto $\\{\\hat X^*, X\\}$ (instead of $\\{X^*, X\\}$). If both the initial \"guess\" $\\hat X^*$ and $Y$ regressed onto the $\\{\\hat X^*, X\\}$ are obtained using ordinary least squares, this procedure is known as two-stage least squares (2SLS)."

    "For a concrete example, suppose a researcher wishes to estimate the causal effect of drinking tea on fever reduction (only among sick patients, of course, as there is no need for fever reduction among healthy individuals). Correlation between the amount of tea a patient drinks and fever reduction does not necessarily imply that drinking tea improves health, because other variables, such as how long the patient has been sick and how much medication they are taking, might relate to both one's health and the amount of consumed tea. However, the researcher may attempt to estimate the causal effect of drinking tea on health by using instrumental variables. Suppose that drinking tea is sufficiently correlated with the outside temperature. Then, the researcher can use outside temperature as an instrumental variable, as it is fairly reasonable to assume that it doesn't directly affect fever reduction (but only through tea consumption)."
